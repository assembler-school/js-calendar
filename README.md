</p>

In this project you will have to create a calendar using the main web fundamentals.

The calendar must be interactive for the users allowing them to create events without refreshing the whole page.

## Requirements

- You must develop this project using a single HTML page
- You cannot use third-party libraries
- You must use localStorage to store all the events, this way, if you reload the page, the events will remain stored in the browser
- You must use semantic HTML5 elements for all the contents of the application
